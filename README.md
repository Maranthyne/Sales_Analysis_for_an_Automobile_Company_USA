# Sales_Analysis_for_an_Automobile_Company_USA
A data science project that analysed the sales performance of an automobile company based in the United States. The companyâ€™s sales transaction data generated over the past years was used for this analysis.
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
What are the Top Most-Profitable 5 States for the Bike Product Category in the United States?
## DATA PRE-PROCESSING
#### DATA LOADING
```Python
## importing the necessary python packages 

import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

print("The packages have been imported")





```
```Python
# reading the sale data into a pandas dataframe 

bikes_df = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/Windows/OneDrive/Desktop/DATA SCIENCE FILES/DATA SETS/bikes.csv")

bikes_df.head()




```

## DATA MODIFICATION
```Python
# Adding the following 3 columns to the pansdas Dataframe: bikes_df


# TotalCostPrice : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x CostPrice_usd)


bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["CostPrice_usd"] 


# SalesRevenue : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x SellingPrice_usd)


bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["SellingPrice_usd"] 


# Profit : To be obtained by (SalesRevenue - TotalCostPrice)


bikes_df["Profit"] = bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] - bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"]


bikes_df.head()



```

## DATA ANALYSIS
## DATA FILTERING
```Python
# Extracting bikes sales data from the US 

is_USA = bikes_df["CustomerCountry"] == "United States"

is_bikes = bikes_df["ProductCategory"] == "Bikes"

bikes_in_US = bikes_df[(is_USA) & (is_bikes)]

bikes_in_US.head()



```

#### DATA AGGREGATION
```Python
# aggregating and summarising data for bike sales

bikes_in_US.pivot_table(values = "Profit", index = "CustomerState", aggfunc = np.sum)

Total_profit_by_state = bikes_in_US.pivot_table(values = "Profit", index = "CustomerState", aggfunc = np.sum)

Total_profit_by_state


```

#### DATA SORTING
```Python
# sorting the aggregated bike sales data to rank the states according to the most profitable states

Total_profit_by_state.sort_values("Profit", ascending = False)

top_5_profitable_states_USA = Total_profit_by_state.sort_values("Profit", ascending = False)

top_5_profitable_states_USA.head()


```

#### RESULT
```Python
# What are the Top Most-Profitable 5 States for the Bike Product Category in the United States?

top_5_profitable_states_USA.head()


```

## DATA VISUALIZATION
```Python
# Visualising the aggregated and sorted data

top_5_profitable_states_USA.plot(kind = "bar")

plt.title("The Top 5 Most Profitable States in the US for Bikes")

plt.ylabel("Total profit in million dollars")

plt.xlabel("States")

plt.show()
